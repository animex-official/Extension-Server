### **Project Status: Pre-Release**

**Estimated Release:** Late July (Date TBD)

2.  **Extract:** Unzip the file in your desired location.
3.  **Add Modules:** Place the `.module` files (from this repository or other sources) into the `{path}/modules/` directory.
4.  **Install Python:** Ensure you have [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.
